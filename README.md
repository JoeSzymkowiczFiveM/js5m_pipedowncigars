## Description
This is a FiveM MLO for Pipe Down Cigar shop, near Mission Row, that was created for me by the mapper [Luky00010](https://forum.cfx.re/u/luky00010/summary). The store has a front entrance from the street, and a rear entrance into the alley.

## Usage
Add these files to a folder in your server resources and ensure it. Easy peasy.
